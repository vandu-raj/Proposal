      <h2>I’m Truly, Deeply Sorry for Everything I Did 💔</h2>
      <p>I know I’ve hurt you, I know I messed up, and I really feel bad about it — but more than that, I miss us. Our random talks, our cute fights, our late-night laughs — everything. I don’t want to carry the sadness anymore; I want us back — stronger, happier, and crazier than ever. I still blush when I think of you, and I still smile when your name pops up. I love you — always have, always will. Let’s bring back that magic again, together.</p>

      <h2>Let’s Build Our Always — Together 💍</h2>
      <p>You’re not just a part of my life — you are my life. Every little moment with you feels like magic wrapped in reality. I don’t want a perfect love story, I want a real one — ours. Filled with inside jokes, silly selfies, surprise hugs, and late-night talks. I want to hold your hand in crowds and in chaos — through every up and down. Let’s build a love that’s messy, genuine, and lasts forever. I love you, not just today — but every single tomorrow too.</p>

      <h2>I’ll Never Lie to You — That’s My Forever Promise 🤞🤞</h2>
      <p>I swear on all things sweet — I’ll always be honest with you. No hidden truths, no half-words — just real feelings, real love, and real ‘us’. You’ll never feel like you’re alone in this — because I’m with you, every heartbeat of the way. I love you — deeply, purely, and truthfully. Pinky promise.</p>

      <h2>You Said YES — And My Heart Skipped a Lifetime 💞💞</h2>
      <p>When you said yes, everything felt right again — like the stars finally aligned, like the world paused for a moment just to smile at us. You, me, this bond — it’s something rare, something forever. So here we are… starting again from the — same love, same warmth, and the same song that played in our hearts back then.
        I've added it from YouTube — it's ours.
        
        Let’s begin this new chapter — filled with soft touches, endless cuddles, cute fights, stronger bonds, and love that never fades.I love you more than words can say.
        I love you Babu❤️❤️</p>
